# **PipeTracker**

My initial idea for this project was to create an application for my husbandÂ´s plumbing business. He is self-employed and I created his Logo, Designs and Website. So I wanted to make a real-world application where I could put this to use.

After talking to him about possible applications he might need that would be suitable for this project, the idea of an inventory tool - **PipeTracker** - quickly came to life. 

## **Planning**

### **Target Audience**

As this project is intended to be a specific real-world application for my husband, he and possible employees are my target audience or customers. But in general, a tool like this could be used for all plumbing companies so a few characteristics for my target audience would be the following.

- A plumbing company that wants to keep track of its inventory with an online application.
- Anybody who wants to manage stock items and have an overview of the current value they have in stock.
- A plumber who wants to easily create an invoice from the stock items used for a customer.
