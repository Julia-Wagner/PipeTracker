# **PipeTracker**

## **Planning**

I tried to structure my planning phase using the 5 UX planes - strategy, scope, structure, skeleton and surface. The planning process was iterative and while getting a better idea of the project´s scope and speaking to my customer about his needs for the application these planes changed creating a user-centered design for PipeTracker.

### **Strategy Plane**

My initial idea for this project was to create an application for my husband´s plumbing business. He is self-employed and I created his Logo, Designs and Website. So I wanted to make a real-world application where I could put this to use.

After talking to him about possible applications he might need that would be suitable for this project, the idea of an inventory tool - **PipeTracker** - quickly came to life.

#### **Target Audience**

As this project is intended to be a specific real-world application for my husband, he and possible employees are my target audience or customers. But in general, a tool like this could be used for all plumbing companies so a few characteristics for my target audience would be the following.

- A plumbing company that wants to keep track of its inventory with an online application.
- Anybody who wants to manage stock items and have an overview of the current value they have in stock.
- A plumber who wants to easily create an invoice from the stock items used for a customer.

### **Design**

As mentioned above, I already created a [website](https://p-wagner.at/), as well as all the designs and logos for my husband´s company before starting this project. I will use the existing design for this project. As a reference, here is what the company´s business card I designed looks like.

I used shades of blue and the background representing water as it is fitting for a plumbing company. The logo is my husband´s name with the services he offers.

From this existing design, I created the color scheme for this project. I used [contrast-grid.eightshapes.com](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23274060%0D%0A%2300B2CA%0D%0A%23041020%0D%0A%23f9f9f9&es-color-form__tile-size=regular&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp) to check the contrast and possible color combinations.

I will use the same fonts for this project as I used on the website. **Roboto** and **Montserrat** are both Google Fonts and fit well with the logo and design of the company.
