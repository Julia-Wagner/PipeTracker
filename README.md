# **PipeTracker**

My initial idea for this project was to create an application for my husbandÂ´s plumbing business. He is self-employed and I created his Logo, Designs and Website. So I wanted to make a real-world application where I could put this to use.

After talking to him about possible applications he might need that would be suitable for this project, the idea of an inventory tool - **PipeTracker** - quickly came to life.
