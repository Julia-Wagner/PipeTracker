## **Manual Testing**

I started this project by setting everything up and deploying it right away. While developing new features, I tested them on the local version. After finishing and pushing features or parts of them, I tested them on the deployed project.

I always tested new input by entering incorrect information and trying to break it. This way I ensured correct error handling and feedback to the user.

I regularly tested the application in different browsers and devices, like my phone and tablet. When I found a bug while testing on my phone, I created a **Bug Issue** on my Kanban board and provided details and screenshots.

The *#peer-code-review* channel on Code InstituteÂ´s Slack was used to get some feedback from other students. I also sent the link to my project to friends and family asking them to test it.

I tested to a minimum screen width of **300px** and a maximum screen width of **3440px** with my monitor. To test **Safari** and **iOS devices** I used [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/).
